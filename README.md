# Overview üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è

This is my first project on Start2Impact University for become a Full Stack Developer!! The project provided for the creation of a personal website using HTML and CSS.

I tried to create a site with a simple and fluid structure, so as to make the user experience as simple as possible. In the site I used a combination of colors that recall the sky to convey to the user tranquility and positivity that are two moods that represent me.

I started by creating a sticky responsive menu (hooked to the top of the screen). In mobile mode I inserted the drop-down menu while in tablet and pc mode the menu becomes classic with the various sections on the site visible.

I continued by creating the presentation section where I inserted a photo of myself and a welcome phrase.

After that, I created the bio section where I described myself to give the user a description of myself as accurate as possible.

Then I inserted the part of the portfolio where I put the image of this project with the button that refers to the site. Being my first project, I could only insert this.

Continuing I created the skill section where I made a grid where I inserted all the programs I know how to use. Clicking on each program will open a tab where there is the wikipedia page of the related program in which the user can have its explanation.

Then I created the contacts section where I made a form where filling in all the data and pressing the button I get the email directly. To make this possible, I hooked onto the [formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co/) platform.

Finally I created a footer in which I inserted the images of Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin and GitHub. Clicking on it, the user will be redirect to my profile of the relative social.
